            <h1>TOP WORKOUT SESSION</h1>
            <p>You are now about to get to know the fitness floor and the
machines at the gym. Use light weights and focus on good
technique. Aim for 12-15 repetitions and rest 1-2 minutes between
sets. Start the session with a warm-up. For this, do 5 minutes on
the treadmill and then do some dynamic mobility. We use dynamic
mobility so that we can move freely throughout our joints with
control and also to prepare the body for the workout. We focus on
hip openers, t-spine and shoulder mobilizations.

            <h1>FEATURED BOOTCAMPS</h1>
            <p>A gym bootcamp is an intense, fast-paced workout program designed to improve strength, endurance, and overall fitness.
            The main part of the bootcamp usually includes a combination of strength and cardio exercises.
            Bootcamp workouts often change weekly or monthly to keep participants engaged and challenged.
            The camaraderie of working out in a group can motivate participants to push harder.
            Typically led by an instructor who provides guidance, modifications, and encouragement.

                    <h4>SPECIFICITY.</h4>
                    <p>There are several different exercises and events that can develop your
muscular strength as well as cardiovascular fitness. To increase the number of push-ups you can
do, simply increase upper body strength through a number of strength exercises and weights.
However, the best way to improve push-ups requires doing push-ups. Similarly one can improve
cardiovascular fitness by biking swimming, or walking. However, if the goal remains an
improved ability to run, the best exercise will be running.</p>

                    <h4>MAJOR COMPONENTS OF PHYSICAL FITNESS.</h4>
                    <p>There are several components of
any fitness program. The three major components of most programs are flexibility, strength,
muscular endurance, and cardiovascular endurance. These components are the essential
elements of the Army Physical Fitness Program. </p>

                    <h4>GENERAL ADAPTATION PRINCIPAL (GAP).</h4>
                    <p>Muscles as well as your
cardiovascular system in the body will adapt to the increasing stress placed upon it through
exercise. To see gains in a fitness program one must stress the existing muscular and
cardiovascular systems. This can also be called the OVERLOAD principal. For a muscle to
increase in strength, the workload during exercise must be larger than what it normally
experience.</p>

                    <h4>RECOVERY </h4>
                    <p> Do not work the same muscle groups hard day after day. Muscles
need recovery time. People frequently misunderstand this point. Providing inadequate recovery
can explain the reason why most people see little or no gain from excessive exercise. You can
work the same muscle groups each day, however, you should work hard one day and easy the
next. This is a critical point because this fitness program is based on a six days a week exercise
program.</p>
